# JS-alogithims

This repository contains some basic algorithms translated into JavaScript. Might rewrite it in TypeScript later.
If you ever needed a certain algorithm implemented in Javascript, this repository might be just for you, since the code is described with comments, so you can understand what's going on a bit better.
